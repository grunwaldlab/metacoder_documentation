**Niklaus J. Gr&uuml;nwald** is a plant pathologist with the USDA Agricultural
Research Service and a Professor in the Department of Botany and Pant Pathology
and the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University.
He received his PhD from UC Davis and conducted postdoctoral research at Cornell
University. His research focuses on understanding the evolutionary patterns and
processes of emerging pathogens using population genetic and evolutionary
approaches and development of computational tools for characterizing pathogens and communities. Members of his group have developed several widely used R packages including: [*poppr*](http://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr), [*vcfr*](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/vcfR), [*taxa*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxa/index.html), and [*metacoder*](https://github.com/grunwaldlab/metacoder).
