## Parsing, manipulating, and visualizing taxonomic data in R

### Motivation:

* High-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA has led to large taxonomic data sets
* The hierarchical nature of taxonomic classifications make manipulating them and associated data difficult

### The `taxa` package:

* Flexible reading of most sources of taxonomic information
* `dplyr`-inspired filtering and subsetting of taxa and associated information
* A standard set of classes for taxonomic data
